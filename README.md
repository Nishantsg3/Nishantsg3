## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m an entry-level software developer focused on building **functional, real-world applications** rather than tutorial-only demos.

I enjoy working with core fundamentals — clean logic, structured code, meaningful data handling, and systems that can be clearly explained and extended.

My current focus is **Java backend development**, SQL, and full-stack fundamentals.
