## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m an entry-level software developer focused on building **real, working applications** rather than tutorial-only projects.

I enjoy working close to the fundamentals — clean logic, structured code, meaningful database design, and projects that I can confidently explain in interviews.

My current focus is on **Java backend development**, SQL, and full-stack fundamentals.
