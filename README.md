## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m an entry-level software developer focused on building **real, functional applications** that simulate real-world systems rather than tutorial-only demos.

I enjoy working close to the fundamentals — clean logic, structured code, meaningful data handling, and projects that I can confidently explain in interviews.

My primary focus is **Java backend development**, SQL, and full-stack fundamentals.
