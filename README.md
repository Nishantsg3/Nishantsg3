## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m an entry-level software developer focused on **building real, working applications**, not just tutorial demos.

I enjoy working close to the fundamentals — clean logic, structured code, databases that actually make sense, and projects that can be explained confidently in interviews.

Currently focused on **Java backend development**, SQL, and full-stack basics.
